rupclass
========

Robust modification to the Model-Based Classification framework, employing impartial trimming and constraints on the ratio between the maximum and the minimum eigenvalue of the group scatter matrices. Both supervised (redda) and semi-supervised (rupclass) versions are included.

This repository is associated with the paper Cappozzo, Greselin, Murphy (2020) *A robust approach to model-based classification based on trimming and constraints.* [https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-019-00371-w](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-019-00371-w)
